## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. 
- The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. 
- So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
- We need to create a multiple linear regression model for predicting the demand for the shared bikes to help the company plan better

## Conclusions
- The prediction variable ('cnt') in the dataset has a linear relation with the predictor variables.
- During Falls and Summer, people seems to be more active and see high demand for bikes.
- Final model was built with 12 features
- r2-score for train data is 0.79
- r2-score for test data is 0.78
